			<div class="col-md-6 col-lg-6"><h4>Vacuum and Pre-Spray</h4>
			<p>Before, we start with the steam cleaning, we vacuum the carpet in two directions, first in one direction followed by a round at a 90-degree angle. Vacuuming in different directions ensures that each side of the thread in the carpet gets thoroughly cleaned. After that, a pre-spray is applied to alleviate the surface tension of the carpet. Thus, hot water gets easily penetrated into the fibres, allowing for a profound clean.</p>

			<h4>Steam Clean</h4>
			<p>The next step involves using our powerful steam cleaner, which forces hot water into the carpet using a high-pressure jet spray, and removes water and dirt from the carpet with its constant force of suction.</p>
